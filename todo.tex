  3. inconsistency in the section numbering. For example, in chapter 2 the headings for sec. 2.2, 2.3 and 2.6 have an extra digit which does not happen for sec. 2.1, 2.4, 2.5.  As far as I can tell, all of these headings have the same format in the .doc file. Similar issue for next level down: sec. 2.6.3 has extra digits but the other subsections within 2.6 do not.  (See also chapter 10, sec. 10.2)
  9. The ‘and’ and ‘or’ symbols in the logic notation seem very small; see for example sec. 4.2.1. In the “not-equal” sign, the diagonal line looks too far to the right, as in sec. 14.3.  Otherwise, the logical and set theory symbols look good.
  Lines, shading and formatting lost from the truth tables in sec. 4.2.1.
